.SYNOPSIS
    Retrieves the GUID of the installed TeamViewer product.

.DESCRIPTION
    This function queries the Win32_Product WMI class to retrieve the GUID of the 
    installed TeamViewer product based on the product name provided. The GUID is 
    required for uninstallation using msiexec.

.PARAMETER productName
    The name of the product for which to retrieve the GUID. For example, "TeamViewer Host".

.EXAMPLE
    $productGUID = Get-TeamViewerGUID -productName "TeamViewer Host"

    This command retrieves the GUID of the installed TeamViewer Host product and 
    stores it in the $productGUID variable.

.NOTES
    The function queries the Win32_Product WMI class, which may take some time to 
    execute, especially if there are many installed products.
